## Questions

### Which One Should I Start with, UIKit or SwiftUI?
In 2022, most companies still use UIKit actively. In case we work for a company, we will most probably face with a project written in UIKit, not SwiftUI. Also, SwiftUI has still some weaknesses rather than UIKit. When we come over a weakness of SwiftUI, we must build a bridge via UIKit by using **[UIViewRepresentable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/uiviewrepresentable)**. We must have UIKit knowledge to build that bridge.
In conclusion, it is better to start with UIKit. After we have a job and we feel that we are okay with UIKit knowledge, we are free to improve our SwiftUI skills in our free time except during working hours.
